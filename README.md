## How it works
User is presented with landing page and must click 'Start Quiz' to begin playing.
![Step-1 Screenshot](./assets/images/quiz-step-1.png)<br><br>
User will be presented with a question and four answer choices. If the user chooses the correct answer, the next question is presented. If the user chooses an incorrect answer, 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer.

The game will end when the time has run out or all questions were correctly answered.

## Bugs
* Loop through questions
* Check user answer choice against correct answer
* High Scores not saved to local storage
